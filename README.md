# ♠️ Blackjack Game in Python

**Overview**:
This project is a Python implementation of the classic card game Blackjack. It features a comprehensive set of modules to handle the various components of the game, including game logic, player and dealer interactions, and utility functions.

**Project Structure**:

- blackjack.py: The main script that orchestrates the game flow, including dealing cards, handling bets, and determining game outcomes.
- blackjack_helper.py: Contains helper functions used by the main game logic, such as card dealing and hand evaluation.
- dealer.py: Defines the dealer's behavior and card-handling logic.
- end_status.py: Manages the end-of-game status, including win/loss conditions and game summaries.
- name.py: Handles player and dealer naming conventions.
- test_blackjack_helper.py and test_helper.py: Test scripts to ensure the correctness and functionality of helper functions.
- user.py: Manages player actions and interactions during the game.
- value.py: Defines card values and related utility functions.
  
**Skills Demonstrated**:

- Object-Oriented Programming: Utilizes classes and objects to model game entities like the dealer and player.
- Modular Programming: Breaks down the game into separate modules for better organization and maintainability.
- Testing: Implements unit tests to verify the correctness of game logic and helper functions.
- Game Design: Applies rules and logic of Blackjack to create an engaging and functional game.
